description: 'An exhilarating gathering of around 300 participants took place at this year's International Symposium on Photochemistry 
and Photophysics of Coordination Compounds (ISPPCC) 2023 in Ulm, where a stimulating exchange of scientific knowledge unfolded. 
As an invited speaker at the pre-conference for young researchers and early-career scientists, known as ySPPCC, 
I had a remarkable opportunity to present crucial academic career strategies to the enthusiastic audience.'
