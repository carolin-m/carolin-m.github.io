description: 'Check out our latest publication <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-021-00860-6" style="color:#FFFFFF;"><b>Active repair of a dinuclear photocatalyst for visible-light-driven hydrogen production</b></a> on the mechanistic understanding of the catalytic cycle of a dinuclear RuPt photocatalyst. We present active repair strategies that allow to increase the catalytic activity from a few hours to a few days. The complementary study includes <i>e.g.</i> catalytic studies, <i>operando</i> steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as (TD-)DFT simulations.'
