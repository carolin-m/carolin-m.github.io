description: '<span class="dropcap">C</span>heck out our latest publication ([**Active repair of a dinuclear photocatalyst for visible-light-driven hydrogen production**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-021-00860-6)) on the mechanistic understanding of the catalytic cycle of a dinuclear RuPt photocatalyst.
We present active repair strategies that allow to increase the catalytic activity from a few hours to a few days. The complementary study 
includes *e.g.* catalytic studies, *operando* steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as (TD-)DFT simulations.'
