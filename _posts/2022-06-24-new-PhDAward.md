description: 'I am delighted to announce that I have won the PhD Award from the Faculty of Chemistry and Earth Sciences 
of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. Unfortunately, I could only attend the ceremony online so there 
is no picture with the certificate. ðŸ˜‰ <br><br>
Many thanks to the working group, collaboration partners (especially the CataLight team) and my supervisor 
Benjamin Dietzek-Ivansic â€“ Without YOU this would not have been possible.'
