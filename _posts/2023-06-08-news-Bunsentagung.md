description: "About 500 participants gathered for a stimulating exchange of scientific knowledge at this year's Bunsen Meeting 2023, a renowned conference in the field of physical chemistry.
Being a participant at the conference, I had the chance to make several contributions. 
On the one hand, I had the opportunity to present my research by giving a talk. 
On the other hand, as an active member of the Young Physical Chemists (yPCs) of the German Bunsen Society for 
Physical Chemistry e.V., I was involved in the organization and execution of the penal discussion 
*PhD â€“ and then?* as well as a juror for the Agnes-Pockels PhD award."
