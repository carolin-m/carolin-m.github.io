description: "I am thrilled to announce that the <a href='https://estml.github.io/'>ESTML 2023</a> conference, I co-organized with Adil Kabylda , Hilda Sandström, and Ransell D'Souza, just wrapped up in Levi, Lapland! The event featured 19 talks and 6 posters, and brought together three renowned research groups: Alexandre Tkatchenko (University of Luxembourg), Patrick Rinke (Aalto University), and Milica Todorović (University of Turku). The quality of the talks, posters, and discussions was incredible, and I am immensely grateful to everyone who helped make this conference a success."
