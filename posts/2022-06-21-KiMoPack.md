<span class="dropcap">I</span>n chemical research and industry, understanding light-driven reactions is critical for developing design methods 
for photoactive molecules. Appropriate data analysis makes a significant contribution to this understanding.
In this context, I proudly present our latest publication about 
[**KiMoPack**: A python Package for Kinetic Modeling of the Chemical Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c00907).

**KiMoPack** is a powerful, **python**-based, **open-source** analysis tool that operates *via* Jupyter 
noteboooks and thus provides a powerful but easy-to-use interface for **well-documented, flexible, and 
reproducible** analysis (kinetic modeling) of time-resolved spectral data (*e.g.*, transient absorption data).

In an *input-*, *optimization-*, as well as a *collecting- and plotting routine*, **KiMoPack** offers a 
comprehensive data analysis covering a wide variety of processing steps.
**KiMoPack** has a basic and advanced optimization routine that allows for state-of-the-art global 
lifetime analysis (sum of exponentials), as well as target and advanced modelling 
(*e.g.* multi-experiment or distributed-rate model analysis). Thus, **KiMoPack** bridges the gap 
between data sets and data interpretation with its wide range of routines and ease of usage.
