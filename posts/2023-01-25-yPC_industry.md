<span class="dropcap"> A</span>s a member of the <a href="https://bunsen.de/ypc"> <b>young Physical Chemists</b> </a> of the German Bunsen Society, I was thrilled to organize a lecture on the topic of 'AI in Chemistry' in our lecture series <b>yPC meets industry</b>. 
On the 25<sup>th</sup> of January, 75 participants eager to learn about the most recent advancements in the field of AI in chemistry attended the online seminar. 

AI has been making great strides in various industries, and chemistry is no exception. 
The use of AI in chemistry can greatly enhance the speed and accuracy of chemical reactions and analysis, leading to more efficient and 
cost-effective processes.
  Our two experts from industry, namely <b>Dr. Frank Nussbaum</b>, data scientist at Jenoptik, and <b>Dr. Jan Sperrhake</b>, CEO of Xsight Optics, shared their insights and expertise on how AI is revolutionizing their field of work.
They shared case studies and examples where AI is used (and not used) to streamline workflows and improve the accuracy of predictions.

I want to sincerely thank Jan and Frank for their contribution to this event.
Their presentations gave the attendees useful insight and introduced new perspectives.
I also want to express my thanks to all of the attendees for coming and helping to make the event a huge success. 
In the future, I'm looking forward to co-organizing more events like this where we can bring together experts from industry and members of the scientific community to exchange thoughts and viewpoints.
