<span class="dropcap"> I</span>t was a great pleasure for me to co-organise a Christmas Workshop at the University of Luxembourg with Dr. Mario Galante and Dr. Aridani Boziki - 
my colleagues in the TCP group of Prof. Alexandre Tkatchenko.
We had a successful and inspiring Event, on the 14<sup>th</sup> of December with many exciting and intersting 
presentations and discussions.

Many thanks to our external speakers: Dr. Johannes Hoja (AUT), Dr. Mattias Rupp (LUX), Dr. Stefan Chmiela (GER),
Hartmut Maennel (GER), and Assoc. Prof. Rocco Martinazzo (ITA).
