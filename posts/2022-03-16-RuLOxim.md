<span class="dropcap">P</span>hotosensitizers need to fulfill many properties to act successfully in catalytic processes such as proton 
reduction. These include, for example, strong MLCT absorption in the visible range, excited-state lifetimes 
appropriate for intermolecular processes, sufficient redox potentials of the photo-oxidized and reduced species 
to react with sacrificial electron donors or catalysts as well as (photo-)chemical stability. Another major 
aspect is the ability to maintain these properties over a wide pH range, since catalytic processes often 
involve drastic changes in pH.

In our latest study – [**A Combined Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study on a Ruthenium Complex Featuring a 
π-Extended dppz Ligand for Light-Driven Accumulation of Multiple Reducing Equivalents**](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202103882) – 
we report the photophysics of protonation and redox isomers of a ruthenium photosensitizer. This complex bears 
a **dipyridophenazine-type (dppz)** ligand, which is linearly π-extended by a **pyridoquinolinone (pq)** moiety. 
We show that the photophysical properties, such as the composition of the initially excited states and the 
photoinduced dynamics, are determined by the pq-moiety. However, even upon *protonation* or *proton-coupled 
reduction (two-fold)* at this moiety, the essential properties of the photosensitizer, namely strong MLCT 
absorption in the visible and the population of long-lived, low-lying ππ* states are maintained.
