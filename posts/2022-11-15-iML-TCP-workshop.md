<span class="dropcap"> W</span>e, the TCP group of Prof. Alexandre Tkatchenko, had a successful and inspiring 2<sup>nd</sup> internal Machine Learning Workshop 
on the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of November. 
The programme included many exciting presentations, professional exchange and interesting discussions about current 
challenges and future paths. 
It was a great pleasure for me to organise this workshop. 
Thanks to the TCP group for their active participation.
