<span class="dropcap">I</span> am thrilled to announce that the [ESTML 2023](https://estml.github.io/) conference , 
I co-organized with Adil Kabylda , Hilda Sandström, and Ransell D'Souza, just wrapped up in Levi, Lapland! 
The event featured 19 talks and 6 posters, and brought together three renowned research groups: 
Alexandre Tkatchenko (University of Luxembourg), Patrick Rinke (Aalto University), and Milica Todorović (University of Turku).
The quality of the talks, posters, and discussions was incredible, 
and I'm immensely grateful to everyone who helped make this conference a success.
