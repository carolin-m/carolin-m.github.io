<span class="dropcap"> W</span>elcome to my monthly blog series, where I share my 'AHA' moments in my research journey.
In this first post, I want to take you on my journey of jumping into action and share with you some of my 
insights about the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.459170"> üìö surface hopping</a> method.

________________

#### Have you ever wondered how the non-adiabatic couplings come into play in the formulas of surface hopping?

It all begins with the time-dependent electronic wave-function, expressed as a linear combination of the electronic basis states *(1)*:

$$\displaystyle \Psi(R,t) = \sum_{a} c_{a}(t)\left|\varphi_{a}(R;t)\right\rangle$$

In this formula, *a* runs over all basis states, *c<sub>a</sub>* are time-dependent coefficients, 
and $$\varphi_i(R;t)$$ are the basis states. 
The latter case is, where things get interesting ‚Äì the basis states are implicit time-dependent, 
as they depend on the coordinates of the nuclei (*R*), which are indeed time-dependent 
(*This is indicated in the formula by the semicolon.*)! 

We start with the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation *(2)*:

$$\displaystyle i \frac{\partial \Psi(t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi(t)$$

When we insert *(1)* into the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation *(2)*, we get the following equation:

$$\displaystyle i \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \sum_{a} c_{a} \left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle \right) = \hat{H} \sum_{a} c_{a}\left|\varphi_{a} \right\rangle$$

First we use the product rule for the derivative:

$$\displaystyle i \left( \sum_a \left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle \frac{\partial}{\partial t}c_a + \sum_a c_a \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle \right) = \hat{H} \sum_{a} c_{a}\left|\varphi_{a} \right\rangle$$

Next, we use the chain rule:

$$\displaystyle i \left( \sum_a \left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle \frac{\partial}{\partial t}c_a + \sum_a c_a \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} \frac{\partial}{\partial R} \left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle \right) = \hat{H} \sum_{a} c_{a}\left|\varphi_{a}\right\rangle$$

Now we project on a state:

$$\displaystyle i \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}c_b + \sum_a c_a \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} \left\langle\varphi_b | \nabla_R\varphi_a\right\rangle \right) = \sum_a c_a \left\langle \varphi_b | \hat{H} | \varphi_a\right\rangle $$

üîñ Note: In order to get the first derivative of the basis function, we have to use the chain rule, as the basis function is time dependent *via* the position of the nuclei *R*. By using the chain rule, we end up with a product of velocity and non-adiabatic couplings:

$$\displaystyle v = \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}$$

$$\displaystyle C_{ba} = \left\langle\varphi_b | \nabla_R\varphi_a\right\rangle$$

With

$$\displaystyle H_{ba} = \left\langle \varphi_b | \hat{H} | \varphi_a\right\rangle$$

the general formula for the quantum amplitudes along the trajectory path, reads:

$$\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial t} c_b = - \sum_a c_a \left(i H_{ba} + v C_{ba} \right)$$

I look forward to sharing my next 'AHA' moment with you in March!
