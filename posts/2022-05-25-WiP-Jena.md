<span class="dropcap">I</span>n the <b>Women in Photonics</b> Workshop at the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology in Jena (Germany), about <b>80</b> 
  participants out of <b>14</b> countries had the opportunity to inform themselves about career opportunities in the 
  photonics sector and to exchange ideas in more than <b>40</b> presentations. Thankfully, I also had the opportunity 
to present my research results concerning the operando-spectroscopic investigation of photocatalytic 
multi-electron processes. Overall, it was very inspiring and a great pleasure to meet such brilliant minds and 
scientists and to share my research with them.
