About 500 participants gathered for a stimulating exchange of scientific knowledge at this year's Bunsen Meeting 2023, a renowned conference in the field of physical chemistry.
Being a participant at the conference, I had the chance to make several contributions. 
On the one hand, I had the opportunity to present my research by giving a talk. 
On the other hand, as an active member of the Young Physical Chemists (yPCs) of the German Bunsen Society for Physical Chemistry e.V., I was involved in the organization and execution of the penal discussion *PhD – and then?* as well as a juror for the Agnes-Pockels PhD award.

In my talk *Unlocking the Secrets of Photoinduced Isomerization Reactions by Combining Quantum Chemistry and Machine Learning*, 
I demonstrated the synergy between quantum chemistry and machine learning. 🧠🔄💻 By leveraging these two fields, 
I was able to gain comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of photoinduced isomerization reactions. 
This merging of disciplines promises exciting advances in the optimization of chemical processes and opens new frontiers in the field of physical chemistry.

As an enthusiastic member of the yPC community, I co-organized the panel discussion entitled *PhD – and then?*. 🏦🥼💻
This event brought together young researchers and three renowned industry representatives to explore different career paths beyond academia. 
The overwhelming number of attendees and the lively participation showed the importance of listening to the wishes and concerns of PhD students as they plan their future careers. 
In addition, I was also involved in the Agnes Pockels session, where I had the honor of serving as a judge. 👩‍⚖️
In this session, four selected candidates had the chance to present their exceptional achievements in physical chemistry they made during their PhD studies. 
I myself was one of the candidates in this session in 2022, so it was a great honor to be a jury member this year.

Altogether, it was very inspiring and a great pleasure to meet such brilliant minds and scientists and to share my research with them. 👩‍🔬
